# Search The Wandering Inn

This is a search website for ✨[The Wandering Inn]("https://wanderinginn.com")✨,
a great fantasy LitRPG webnovel. It's got memorable characters, expansive worldbuilding, and a gripping story
full of magic and monsters. You should check it out!

I started developing this site while the webnovel's own
search function was broken. It has since been fixed, but I
figured I could improve the UI/UX so I built this site
anyways. Here are some features:

-   Search results with keyword-highlighted excerpts
-   Sorting search results by relevance or by chronology
-   A few Easter eggs...?

I am going to try to deploy this soon.

## Development

This repository contains the source code for both the web client and the server.
To develop locally: clone, `npm install`, and `npm start` to compile and start the server.
Visit `localhost:3000/` to view the website.
If you make changes to the client, run `npm run copy` before visiting the site again.
